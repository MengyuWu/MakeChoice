Our administors review Posts/reports and Emails 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Posts or users that violate "Terms of Service" will be removed from MakeChoice


- Require that users agree to terms (EULA) and these terms must make it clear that there is no tolerance for objectionable content

After login, the “Terms of Service” will show up. The users could not access and post any contents until they agree to the Terms(EULA)

To see the "Terms of Service", click on the "..." button in the profile page.
